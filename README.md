- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Niravaana
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ray tracing, path tracing, light transport simulation, GPU, optimizations.
- ‚ö° Some of my past research work :
    - [Multi-Resolution Geometric Representation using Bounding Volume Hierarchy for Ray Tracing](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/GPUOpen_BVHApproximation.pdf)
    - [The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of multi-resolution geometric representation using Bounding Volume Hierarchy for ray tracing](https://gpuopen.com/learn/why-multi-resolution-geometric-representation-bvh-ray-tracing/)
    - [Fused BVH to Ray Trace Level of Detail Meshes](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/GPUOpen2022_FusedLOD.pdf?trk=public_post_main-feed-card_feed-article-content)
    - [HIPRT: A Ray Tracing Framework in HIP](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Meister-2/publication/382919452_HIPRT_A_Ray_Tracing_Framework_in_HIP/links/66b35fc68f7e1236bc425df1/HIPRT-A-Ray-Tracing-Framework-in-HIP.pdf)
    - [Hierarchical Light Sampling with Accurate Spherical Gaussian Lighting](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/Hierarchical_Light_Sampling_with_Accurate_Spherical_Gaussian_Lighting.pdf)
